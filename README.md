Wet Bulb Temperature App

Enter your location to find the current Wet Bulb Temperature! 

Completed Features: 

- ‚úÖ Autocomplete search bar 
- ‚úÖ Text display that explains the hazard level of the current wet bulb temperature
- ‚úÖ Background color changes based on the hazard level of the current wet bulb temperature 
    - (You likely won't ever see the background turn red!)
- ‚úÖ Set Celsius/Fahrenheit with app bar buttons

Fixed Bugs:

- Bug Fix: When the page is first navigated to, the search bar text "Enter your location" is already panned away. Fix this so that it begins in the center of the search bar. ‚úÖ
- Bug Fix: On mobile, users are unable to "hit enter" or otherwise make a selection in the dropdown ‚úÖ

Bugs to fix:

- Bug Fix: when a user wants to type "SAO PAULO" in the dropdown and types "SAO" it shows Sao Paulo, but if they continue to type: "SAO PA" then Sao Paulo is removed from the dropdown. This only happens for some entries whereas typing "RICHMOND" will still show Richmond, VA at the top of the list. 
- Bug Fix: Border goes around entire search bar with a "lip" instead of just around the search bar (app currently uses default styling while I figure this out)

Future Features List:

- About page that has info about the accuracy of the temp, Stull formula, etc. Links to official org guidlines
- Toggle/selection of guidlines from various organizations 
- Hide app bar text on smaller mobile screens
- Make app bar thinner (possibly on mobile only screens?)
- Automatically set the temperature unit to Celsius when selecting a location outside the US üòè
