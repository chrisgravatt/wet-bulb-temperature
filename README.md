Enter your location to find the current Wet Bulb Temperature! 

TODO:

- Bug Fix: when a user wants to type "SAO PAULO" in the dropdown and types "SAO" it shows Sao Paulo, but if they continue to type: "SAO PA" then Sao Paulo is removed from the dropdown. This only happens for some entries whereas typing "RICHMOND" will still show Richmond, VA at the top of the list. 
- Bug Fix: When the page is first navigated to, the search bar text "Enter your location" is already panned away. Fix this so that it begins in the center of the search bar. 
- Bug Fix: On mobile, users are unable to "hit enter" or otherwise make a selection in the dropdown ✅
- Revert demo version of hazard levels of temperature ✅
